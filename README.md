# PrimeLister

This project is only a toy project and does nothing more then to generate a lot (~250k per second) of (small) prime numbers.
I stated it to get more comfortable about things like:
  - caching
  - multithreading (especially blocking queues with wait/notify)
  - guava
  - logging
  - performance optimizing with profilers
  - spring module hirachy
  - mocking in unit tests
